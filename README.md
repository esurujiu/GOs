This repository contains notebooks and data for hydro analysis.
The original notebook `Hydro_mainly.ipynb` was split into smaller pieces
for clarity:

- `notebooks/Hydro_data_prep.ipynb` – data loading and preprocessing.
- `notebooks/Hydro_analysis.ipynb` – main analysis and modeling.
- `notebooks/Hydro_ttf_eua.ipynb` – TTF/EUA section.

Use these notebooks individually to keep the workflow manageable.
